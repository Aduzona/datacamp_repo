    "# Text preprocessing, POS tagging and NER\n",
    "> In this chapter, you will learn about tokenization and lemmatization. You will then learn how to perform text cleaning, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition using the spaCy library. Upon mastering these concepts, you will proceed to make the Gettysburg address machine-friendly, analyze noun usage in fake news, and identify people mentioned in a TechCrunch article. This is the Summary of lecture \"Feature Engineering for NLP in Python\", via datacamp.\n",
