In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn how to define constants and variables, perform tensor addition and multiplication, and compute derivatives.

    "The 3x3 tensor, `letter`, and the 1x3 tensor, `model`, are available in the Python shell. You can determine whether letter is a K by multiplying letter by model, summing over the result, and then checking if it is equal to 1. As with more complicated models, such as neural networks, `model` is a collection of weights, arranged in a tensor."
