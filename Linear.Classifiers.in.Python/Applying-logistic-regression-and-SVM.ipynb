    "# Applying logistic regression and SVM\n",
    "> In this chapter you will learn the basics of applying logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs) to classification problems. You'll use the scikit-learn library to fit classification models to real data. This is the Summary of lecture \"Linear Classifiers in Python\", via datacamp.\n",

We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided. See the README file contained in the release for more details.\n",
